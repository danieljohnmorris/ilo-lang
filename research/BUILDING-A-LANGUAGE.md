# Building a Programming Language: Research

How people start programming languages from scratch, and what this means for ilo.

## The Pipeline

Every language follows roughly the same path:

```
Source → Lexer → Tokens → Parser → AST → [Interpreter OR Compiler] → Output
```

Most people start with the grammar and a handful of example programs (we have both).

## Parser Approaches

Most production languages use **hand-written recursive descent parsers** (Go, Rust, Python, Swift, Lua). Reasons: better error messages, more performance, more flexibility for context-sensitive quirks.

For expression-heavy languages, a **Pratt parser** handles operator precedence naturally. Given ilo's sigil-based syntax (`?`, `!`, `~`, `@`, `>`), this is the right fit.

| Tool | Type | Best For |
|------|------|----------|
| Hand-written recursive descent | Manual | Production languages, best errors |
| Pratt parser | Manual technique | Operator precedence, expression-heavy |
| ANTLR | Parser generator (LL) | JVM ecosystems, complex grammars |
| PEG parsers (pest, nom) | Combinators | Rust/JS ecosystems, unified lexing+parsing |
| tree-sitter | Incremental generator | Editor integration only, not the language parser |

## The Spectrum: Simple → Complex

### Level 1: Embedded DSL (days)
Language as functions/macros in a host language. No parser needed.

### Level 2: Transpiler (days to weeks)
Parse ilo, output Python/JS, run with host runtime. **Fastest path to execution.** BAML took this approach — transpiles to Python/TypeScript/Ruby, compiler written in Rust.

### Level 3: Tree-Walking Interpreter (weeks)
Parse to AST, walk the tree to execute. Simple, slow, complete. This is Part I of Crafting Interpreters.

### Level 4: Bytecode VM (weeks to months)
Compile AST to bytecode, execute on custom VM. Much faster. Lua, Python, Ruby all use this. Part II of Crafting Interpreters.

### Level 5: Native Compiler via LLVM (months)
Compile to LLVM IR, get native code + optimisations for free. Rust, Swift, Zig use this. Covered by [createlang.rs](https://createlang.rs/).

### Level 6: Custom Backend (months to years)
Only Go does this. Almost never necessary.

## How Famous Languages Started

**Python** — Guido's Christmas vacation project (1989). Tree-walking interpreter in C. Released 0.9.0 in 1991.

**Lua** — Evolved from data-description languages at PUC-Rio. Bytecode VM in C from the start. Entire implementation is ~30,000 lines of C.

**Rust** — Graydon Hoare's personal project (2006). First compiler in OCaml (~38,000 lines). No type checker, terrible codegen. Rewrote in Rust (self-hosted) years later. The OCaml prototype was crucial for exploring the design space cheaply.

**Go** — Designed at Google. First compiler in C, later rewritten in Go. Custom backend (not LLVM) because Ken Thompson had decades of codegen experience.

**Zig** — Started in C++, later self-hosted. Uses LLVM backend.

**Common pattern**: prototype in an existing language → get something running → iterate on design → optionally self-host later.

## Modern Developments (2024-2026)

### AI-Assisted Language Development

**Steve Klabnik's Rue language** is the headline story. A 13-year Rust veteran built a new systems language from scratch using Claude AI:
- ~100,000 lines of Rust in 11 days
- ~700+ commits
- Working compiler in roughly two weeks
- Klabnik directed and reviewed; Claude wrote most of the code

This is directly relevant to ilo — a solo developer with a clear design vision using AI to accelerate implementation.

### Rust as Implementation Language

Rust is the dominant choice for new language tooling: BAML, Rue, SWC, Ruff, Oxc all use it. [createlang.rs](https://createlang.rs/) (completed Dec 2025) provides a full tutorial from lexer through LLVM JIT.

### Other Modern Expectations

- **LSP support early** — IDE integration is expected from the start now
- **tree-sitter grammar** — gives syntax highlighting in most editors
- **WASM as a target** — browser/edge portability via LLVM

## Interpreted vs Compiled: What's Right for ilo?

This is the key question. ilo has a unique position: it's a language for AI agents, with verification-before-execution as the core value prop.

### The Answer: Both (in phases)

**Phase 1: Verifier + Transpiler (interpreted via host)**
- The verifier is ilo's differentiator — build this first
- Transpile to Python for immediate execution
- Agent writes ilo → verifier checks it → transpiler emits Python → Python runs it
- Fastest path to "I can run programs"

**Phase 2: Bytecode VM (compiled to bytecode)**
- Replace transpiler with a proper runtime
- Custom bytecode VM gives full control over execution model
- This matters for tool orchestration, typed-shell semantics
- Lua's approach: small, embeddable, fast enough

**Phase 3: Optional native compilation**
- LLVM backend if performance matters
- WASM target for portability
- Only if the use case demands it

### Why Not Just One?

- Pure interpreter: too slow for compute-heavy work, but ilo programs are mostly I/O (tool calls), so speed may not matter
- Pure compiler: too much upfront work, delays getting real feedback
- Transpiler first: fast feedback loop, throwaway code, replace later

### The Type Checking Question

Type checking happens **at verification time, before execution** — regardless of whether execution is interpreted or compiled. The verifier walks the AST, resolves calls, checks types, validates the function graph. This is independent of how you run the code afterward.

In ilo's model:
1. Agent generates ilo source
2. **Verifier** parses + type-checks (catches errors cheaply)
3. **Runtime** executes (interpreter, transpiler, or compiler — doesn't matter to the agent)

The verifier is the product. The runtime is an implementation detail.

## Recommended Path for ilo

### Step 1: Lexer + Parser (~500-1000 lines)
Hand-written recursive descent + Pratt parser. ilo's grammar is small and sigil-based — this is straightforward. Implementation language: Rust (for the createlang.rs ecosystem and long-term performance) or TypeScript (for faster prototyping).

### Step 2: Verifier
Walk the AST. Check: all calls resolve to known functions, all types align, all dependencies exist. Return structured errors. This is ilo's core innovation.

### Step 3: Transpiler to Python
Walk the AST, emit Python. Get execution working in days. This is throwaway code.

### Step 4: Ship and Learn
Get agents writing and running ilo programs. Learn from real usage. Then decide if you need a bytecode VM, LLVM backend, or if the transpiler is good enough.
