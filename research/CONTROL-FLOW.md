# Control Flow Research

How terse languages handle control flow — patterns, trade-offs, and what ilo should steal.

Evaluated against the manifesto: **total tokens from intent to working code**. A feature is worth adding only if it reduces total token cost across generation + retries + context loading + error feedback.

---

## What ilo has today

| Form | Tokens | What it does |
|------|--------|--------------|
| `cond{body}` | 1 sigil | Guard: return body if cond true |
| `!cond{body}` | 1 sigil | Guard: return body if cond false |
| `?x{arms}` | 1 sigil | Match named value |
| `?{arms}` | 1 sigil | Match last result (implicit) |
| `@v list{body}` | 1 sigil | Iterate list, accumulate |
| `~expr` | 1 sigil | Return Ok |
| `^expr` | 1 sigil | Return Err |
| `func! args` | 1 sigil | Call + auto-unwrap Result |
| `&a b` | 1 sigil | Short-circuit AND |
| `\|a b` | 1 sigil | Short-circuit OR |

This is already terse. The question is: what common patterns still cost too many tokens?

## Lessons from other languages

### Perl — postfix conditionals and implicit variables

**Postfix if/unless:**
```perl
print "yes" if $x > 10;      # condition after action
die "bad"  unless $valid;     # negated postfix
```

Token savings: eliminates braces entirely for single-expression bodies. The condition is a modifier, not a block.

**ilo equivalent today:**
```
>x 10{"yes"}     # 1 guard — already terse
```

**Verdict:** ilo guards are already 1 sigil + braces. Postfix conditionals would save the `{}` (2 tokens) but add parsing ambiguity. Not worth it — the guard form is already minimal.

**`$_` implicit variable (topic variable):**
```perl
for (@items) { print $_ }     # $_ is the implicit loop variable
grep { $_ > 5 } @items;       # $_ used in filter predicate
map { $_ * 2 } @items;        # $_ used in transform
```

Token savings: eliminates naming the loop variable when it's only used once.

**ilo equivalent today:**
```
@x xs{+x 1}     # must name x even for single use
```

**Verdict:** High value for ilo. A topic variable (e.g., `_` or implicit) in `@` loops and future `map`/`flt` would save 1 token per loop. But conflicts with `_` as nil/wildcard. See F3 below.

**`//` defined-or operator:**
```perl
my $name = $input // "default";   # use $input unless undef
```

Token savings: 1 operator vs a full match with nil arm. Equivalent to Kotlin's `?:`, Ruby's `||`, Swift's `??`.

**ilo equivalent today:**
```
?x{_:"default";~v:v}     # 7+ tokens for a nil-or-default
```

**Verdict:** Very high value. See F5 (nil-coalescing).

---

### Ruby — chaining, safe navigation, compact blocks

**Safe navigation `&.`:**
```ruby
user&.address&.city     # returns nil if any link is nil
```

Token savings: eliminates nested nil checks. Each `&.` replaces a full `if x.nil?` guard.

**ilo equivalent today:**
```
# Must guard at each step:
?u{_:_;~u:?u.addr{_:_;~a:a.city}}    # deeply nested, many tokens
```

**Verdict:** Very high value for tool-heavy code where results may be nil. See F6 (safe navigation).

**`||=` assign-if-nil:**
```ruby
@cache ||= expensive_call    # only compute if nil
```

**ilo equivalent today:** No direct equivalent — requires guard + let.

**Verdict:** Low priority. Agents generate fresh code, rarely need memoization.

**Method chaining with blocks:**
```ruby
items.select { |x| x > 5 }.map { |x| x * 2 }.sum
```

Token savings: eliminates intermediate variables entirely. Each step flows into the next.

**ilo equivalent today:**
```
a=@x items{>x 5{x}};b=@x a{*x 2};sum b    # 3 statements, 2 intermediate vars
```

**Verdict:** High value — but requires generics (E5) and lambdas first. The pipe operator (F8) partially addresses this.

---

### Bash — pipes and short-circuit control flow

**Pipes `|`:**
```bash
cat file | grep error | wc -l
```

The pipe model: each stage's output feeds the next stage's input. No intermediate variables. Linear, left-to-right data flow.

**`&&`/`||` as control flow:**
```bash
test -f file && echo "exists" || echo "missing"
```

Token savings: ternary-like branching in 1 line, no `if`/`then`/`fi`.

**ilo equivalent today:**
```
# Already has & and | operators, but they return values, not control flow
# Guard chaining works similarly:
=f file{"exists"};"missing"    # but guards return early, breaking the chain
```

**Verdict:** ilo's `&`/`|` already short-circuit. The missing piece is using them as *expression-level* ternary. See F4 (ternary expression).

---

### APL/J/K — implicit mapping, reduction operators

**Each operator (K):**
```k
2*                     / multiply each by 2 — applied to whole list implicitly
+/                     / reduce with addition
```

**Reduce `/`:**
```apl
+/ 1 2 3 4             ⍝ → 10 (sum)
×/ 1 2 3 4             ⍝ → 24 (product)
```

Token savings: 1 character for reduce. No loop, no accumulator, no lambda.

**Scan `\`:**
```apl
+\ 1 2 3 4             ⍝ → 1 3 6 10 (running sum)
```

**ilo equivalent today:**
```
# No reduce — must use @:
s=0;@x xs{s=+s x};s    # 8 tokens for a sum
```

**Verdict:** Very high value. Reduce is the most common list operation after iteration. A 1-token reduce operator would save 6+ tokens per use. But needs generics (E5). See F9 (reduce operator).

---

### Haskell — composition, guards in function heads, `$` application

**Guards in function definitions:**
```haskell
classify spend
  | spend >= 1000 = "gold"
  | spend >= 500  = "silver"
  | otherwise     = "bronze"
```

**ilo equivalent today:**
```
cls sp:n>t;>=sp 1000{"gold"};>=sp 500{"silver"};"bronze"
```

**Verdict:** ilo's guard syntax already mirrors Haskell guards closely. Already good.

**`$` application (eliminate parens):**
```haskell
f $ g $ h x          -- f(g(h(x)))
```

**`.` composition:**
```haskell
(f . g . h) x        -- same thing, reusable
```

**ilo equivalent today:**
```
a=h x;b=g a;f b      # 3 binds — verbose
```

**Verdict:** Composition/application operators would help but conflict with prefix notation. With prefix, `f (g x)` is already the natural nesting form. The bind-first pattern is verbose but clear. Pipe (F8) is the pragmatic answer.

---

### Elixir — pipe operator `|>` and `with` for happy paths

**Pipe `|>`:**
```elixir
"hello" |> String.upcase() |> String.reverse()
```

Token savings: eliminates intermediate variables for linear chains. Each step flows left-to-right.

**`with` for happy-path chaining:**
```elixir
with {:ok, user} <- get_user(id),
     {:ok, profile} <- get_profile(user),
     {:ok, _} <- send_email(profile) do
  :ok
else
  {:error, reason} -> {:error, reason}
end
```

Token savings: chains multiple fallible operations with a single error clause. Equivalent to Rust's `?` but with explicit else.

**ilo equivalent today:**
```
# Auto-unwrap ! already handles this:
u=get-user! id;p=get-profile! u;send-email! p
```

**Verdict:** ilo's `!` operator already does what Elixir's `with` does — chain fallible calls with automatic error propagation. This is a win ilo already has.

The pipe operator itself is still valuable for non-Result chains. See F8.

---

### Rust — `?` operator, method chaining, `if let`

**`?` operator:**
```rust
let user = get_user(id)?;
let profile = get_profile(&user)?;
```

**ilo equivalent: `!` — already implemented.** Same semantics.

**Iterator chains:**
```rust
items.iter().filter(|x| x > 5).map(|x| x * 2).sum()
```

Token savings: no intermediate variables, lazy evaluation, composable.

**`if let` (partial match):**
```rust
if let Some(x) = maybe_value {
    use(x);
}
```

Token savings: combine match + guard into one form. Only handles one variant.

**ilo equivalent today:**
```
?v{~x:use x}    # match with one arm — similar but always needs ?{}
```

**Verdict:** `if let` maps to single-arm match. ilo's `?v{~x:use x}` is already close. Not worth a new construct.

---

### Awk — implicit loops and pattern-action

**Pattern-action model:**
```awk
/error/ { count++ }         # for every line matching /error/, increment
NR > 10 { print $0 }       # for lines after 10, print
END { print count }         # after all input, print count
```

Token savings: the loop is implicit — awk iterates over input automatically. Pattern-action pairs are concise conditional guards applied per-record.

**Verdict:** Interesting model for tool-output processing, but too domain-specific for a general language. The `@` loop + guard pattern covers this.

---

### Forth/Factor — stack combinators

**Stack-based control:**
```forth
: abs dup 0 < if negate then ;
```

**Factor combinators:**
```factor
{ 1 2 3 } [ 2 * ] map         ! quotation (anonymous function) as argument
5 [ even? ] [ 2 / ] [ 1 + ] if  ! conditional with quotations
```

Token savings: no variable names — values flow through the stack. Combinators (`bi`, `tri`, `cleave`) apply multiple operations to the same value without naming it.

**Verdict:** Stack-based is fundamentally different from ilo's named-variable model. However, the *idea* of applying multiple operations to the same value without re-naming is valuable. Destructuring (F7) and topic variables address this partially.

---

## Proposed syntax for each feature

### F1. Ternary expression — `cond?then:else`

**Problem:** Guard returns from the function. There's no expression-level conditional that doesn't return.

Current workaround:
```
# Use match as expression:
r=?{=x 1:a;_:b}    # 8 tokens
```

**Proposed:** Reuse existing `?` with inline syntax:
```
r==x 1?a:b          # 5 tokens — saves 3
```

Or with prefix condition:
```
r=?=x 1{a}{b}       # ternary with two brace bodies
```

**Inspiration:** C/JS ternary, Perl `$x ? "a" : "b"`, Ruby `x > 0 ? "pos" : "neg"`.

### F2. While loop — `wh cond{body}`

**Problem:** `@` only iterates lists. Polling, convergence, and stateful loops need while.

```
wh >x 0{x=-x 1}     # while x > 0, decrement
```

**2 tokens** for the `wh` keyword + condition + body. Consistent with guard syntax (`cond{body}`).

### F3. Range iteration — `@i 0..n{body}`

**Problem:** Index loops require constructing a list first.

```
@i 0..10{*i i}       # i = 0, 1, 2, ..., 9
@i 0..len xs{xs.i}   # index-based iteration
```

The `..` operator produces a lazy range, no list allocation. Only valid in `@` context.

**Inspiration:** Ruby `0..9`, Rust `0..10`, Python `range(10)`, Kotlin `0 until 10`.

### F4. Nil-coalescing — `a??b`

**Problem:** Handling optional/nil values requires a full match.

Current:
```
?v{_:"default";~x:x}    # 7 tokens
```

Proposed:
```
v??"default"              # 2 tokens — saves 5
```

Evaluates left side. If nil, evaluates right side. Otherwise returns left side.

**Inspiration:** Perl `//`, C# `??`, Kotlin `?:`, Swift `??`, JS `??`.

### F5. Safe navigation — `.?`

**Problem:** Chained field access on possibly-nil values requires nested matches.

Current:
```
?u{_:_;~u:?u.addr{_:_;~a:a.city}}    # deeply nested
```

Proposed:
```
u.?addr.?city            # 3 tokens — returns nil if any step is nil
```

Short-circuits at first nil, returns nil. No match needed.

**Inspiration:** Ruby `&.`, Kotlin `?.`, TypeScript `?.`, C# `?.`.

### F6. Early return — `ret expr`

**Problem:** Can only return from guards or as the last expression. Complex functions sometimes need to exit from the middle.

```
f x:n>n;v=compute x;ret v;cleanup    # cleanup never runs — ret exits
```

**3 tokens** (keyword + space + expr). Rare in ilo style but needed for complex tool orchestration.

### F7. Destructuring bind — `{a;b}=expr`

**Problem:** Extracting multiple fields requires separate statements.

Current:
```
r=get-user! id;n=r.name;e=r.email    # 3 statements, 9 tokens
```

Proposed:
```
{n;e}=get-user! id                   # 1 statement — fields by name
```

Binds `n` to `result.n` and `e` to `result.e` using field name matching. Short field names (ilo convention) make this natural.

**Inspiration:** JS `const {name, email} = obj`, Rust `let Point {x, y} = p`, Elixir `%{name: n} = user`.

### F8. Pipe operator — `>>`

**Problem:** Linear chains of calls require intermediate variables.

Current:
```
a=f x;b=g a;h b       # 3 binds
```

Proposed:
```
f x>>g>>h              # 0 binds, left-to-right flow
```

`>>` passes the result of the left side as the **last** argument of the right side. 2 chars, 1 token.

Why `>>` not `|>`:
- `|` is already logical OR
- `>>` is visually directional (data flows right)
- 1 token in most LLM tokenizers
- Familiar from Haskell (`>>` is monadic sequencing)

**Tension with prefix notation:** Pipe is inherently infix/postfix — it reverses the prefix order. This is fine for *call chains* (which are already left-to-right in ilo: `a=f x;b=g a`). The pipe just drops the bind.

**Inspiration:** Elixir `|>`, F# `|>`, Bash `|`, Haskell `>>`, Unix pipes.

### F9. Break/continue — `brk` / `cnt`

**Problem:** No way to exit a loop early or skip an iteration.

```
@x xs{=x 0{cnt};>x 100{brk};process x}
```

`brk` exits the loop immediately, returning the last accumulated value.
`cnt` skips to the next iteration.

**Inspiration:** C `break`/`continue`, Rust `break`/`continue`, Perl `last`/`next`.

### F10. Guard else — `cond{then}{else}`

**Problem:** Guards return from the function. Sometimes you want if/else *within* a function without returning.

Current workaround:
```
?{=x 1:a;_:b}       # match as if/else — works but clunky
```

Proposed:
```
=x 1{a}{b}           # guard with else block — doesn't return from function
```

Two adjacent brace bodies: first if true, second if false. Same syntax as guard but with an else block.

**Verdict:** Lower priority — match already covers this. But 2 fewer tokens than the match form.

### F11. Reduce operator

Needs generics (E5). Proposed as a builtin `fld` rather than a syntax operator.

```
fld + 0 xs           # fold with +, init 0 — sum
fld * 1 xs           # fold with *, init 1 — product
```

**Inspiration:** APL `+/`, Haskell `foldl`, K `/`, Elixir `Enum.reduce`.

### F12. Type pattern matching

Extends `?` to match on runtime type.

```
?x{n v:*v 2; t v:+v "!"; _:"unknown"}
```

Needed when tools return `t` (raw JSON) as escape hatch and the program must dispatch on actual shape.

---

## Implementation ordering

```
F4 (ternary) ─────────┐
F5 (nil-coalesce) ─────┤
F6 (safe navigation) ──┤── no dependencies, pure syntax + verifier
F1 (early return) ─────┤
F10 (guard else) ──────┘

F2 (while) ────────────┐
F3 (range) ────────────┤── new VM loops
F9 (break/continue) ───┘

F7 (destructuring) ────── needs record type awareness
F8 (pipe) ─────────────── needs call rewriting
F12 (type match) ──────── needs runtime type tags

F11 (reduce) ──────────── gates on E5 (generics)
```

The first group (expression-level features) are highest value and lowest implementation cost. They add no new opcodes — just parser productions and verifier rules.

---

## F0. Braceless single-expression guards

**Status:** Under investigation. Potentially the highest-frequency token saving — every guard in every program benefits.

### The insight

ilo operators have **fixed arity**. `>=` always takes exactly 2 operands. The parser always knows when a condition expression is complete. This means a single-expression guard body doesn't need braces — the parser can tell where the condition ends and the body begins.

### Current syntax

```
cls sp:n>t;>=sp 1000{"gold"};>=sp 500{"silver"};"bronze"
```

Each guard costs `{` + `}` = **2 tokens, 2 chars** of delimiter overhead.

### Proposed syntax

```
cls sp:n>t;>=sp 1000 "gold";>=sp 500 "silver";"bronze"
```

Braces optional when the guard body is a single expression (atom, operator expression, or function call). Multi-statement bodies still require braces.

### Why it works in prefix notation

In infix: `x >= 1000 "gold"` is ambiguous — is `"gold"` part of the comparison?

In ilo's prefix: `>=sp 1000` is provably complete — `>=` takes exactly 2 operands (`sp` and `1000`). The parser knows the condition is finished. The next token (`"gold"`) must be the guard body.

This extends to all conditions:
```
>=sp 1000 "gold"           # binary op: 2 operands → complete
!verified "not ok"         # unary op: 1 operand → complete
=len xs 0 "empty"          # nested: =(len(xs), 0) → complete
&>x 0 <x 100 "in range"   # AND of two comparisons → complete
```

### Token savings analysis

Every guard saves 2 tokens (the braces). A typical ilo program has 2-5 guards.

```
# classify (3 guards): saves 4 tokens (last guard already braceless)
>=sp 1000 "gold";>=sp 500 "silver";"bronze"

# notify (2 guards): saves 2 tokens
!d.verified "not ok";...

# checkout (1 guard): saves 2 tokens
=len its 0 ^"empty cart";...
```

**Average saving: 2-8 tokens per program.** Small per guard, but applies to every guard in every program. High frequency × small saving = significant total.

### Comparison with other languages

| Language | Braceless conditional | Notes |
|----------|----------------------|-------|
| Ruby | `return "gold" if spend >= 1000` | Postfix — condition after action |
| Perl | `print "yes" if $x > 10` | Postfix — same as Ruby |
| Python | `return "gold" if spend >= 1000 else "silver"` | Inline ternary |
| Haskell | `\| spend >= 1000 = "gold"` | Guard clause — no braces |
| CoffeeScript | `"gold" if spend >= 1000` | Postfix — returns expression |
| ilo (proposed) | `>=sp 1000 "gold"` | Prefix — condition before action, no braces |

ilo's approach is unique: prefix notation makes the condition self-delimiting, so no keyword (`if`) or delimiter (`{}`) is needed. The parser exploits fixed arity to know exactly where the condition ends.

### Disambiguation rules

1. **Single atom follows complete condition:** braceless guard body
   ```
   >=sp 1000 "gold"          # "gold" is guard body
   ```

2. **`{` follows complete condition:** braced guard body (existing behaviour)
   ```
   >=sp 1000{a=+sp 1;"gold"} # multi-statement body
   ```

3. **`;` follows complete condition:** expression statement (no guard)
   ```
   >=sp 1000;                 # bare comparison, result discarded
   ```

4. **Operator follows complete condition:** guard body is the operator expression
   ```
   >=sp 1000 +x 1            # guard body is +x 1
   ```

5. **Function call follows:** guard body is the call + its args
   ```
   >=sp 1000 classify sp     # guard body is classify(sp)
   ```

Rule 5 is tricky: how many tokens belong to the call? The parser would need to consume the call greedily (function name + its known arity worth of args), or limit braceless guards to atom/operator bodies only.

### Conservative approach: atoms and operators only

To avoid ambiguity with function calls, braceless guards could be limited to:
- **Atoms:** literals, variable refs, field access — `"gold"`, `x`, `d.name`
- **Prefix operators:** `+x 1`, `*a b`, nested ops
- **Ok/Err wraps:** `~x`, `^"error"`

Function calls as braceless guard bodies would require braces:
```
>=sp 1000 "gold"              # ok — atom
>=sp 1000 +x 1                # ok — prefix operator
>=sp 1000{classify sp}        # braces required — function call
```

This is safe because function calls in guard bodies are uncommon — guards typically return literal values or simple expressions.

### Preventing retries: error hints for the ambiguous case

The manifesto metric is **total tokens from intent to working code**, including retries. If an agent generates a braceless guard with a function call body, the parser must give an actionable error on the **first attempt** — not a cryptic message that burns a retry cycle.

**The failure scenario:**
```
>=sp 1000 classify sp
```
Parser sees `>=sp 1000` (complete), `classify` (identifier → guard body), `sp` (dangling → parse error). Without a hint, the agent gets "unexpected identifier `sp`" and has no idea why.

**The fix — targeted hint using existing infrastructure:**

ilo already has `error_hint()` for cross-language syntax detection (`&&` → `&`, `->` → `>`, `def` → ilo syntax). The same mechanism catches braceless guard ambiguity:

1. **Parser-level:** If a braceless guard body is a single identifier and the next token is NOT `;`, `}`, or EOF, emit:
   ```
   error[ILO-P0xx]: unexpected token after braceless guard body
     --> 1:18
     |
   1 | f x:n>t;>=sp 1000 classify sp
     |                    ^^^^^^^^ this looks like a function call
     |
     = suggestion: function calls in braceless guards need braces: >=sp 1000{classify sp}
   ```

2. **Verifier-level:** If a braceless guard body is a single identifier that matches a known function name, emit a warning:
   ```
   warning: guard body 'classify' is also a function name — did you mean to call it?
     = suggestion: use braces for function call bodies: >=sp 1000{classify sp}
   ```

3. **JSON output:** The hint appears in the `suggestion` field, so agent tooling can auto-fix without human intervention.

**Cost of the hint:** ~0 tokens (computed at parse/verify time, no runtime cost). **Cost of NOT having the hint:** ~100-200 tokens per retry cycle. The hint pays for itself on the first caught ambiguity.

### Interaction with guard-else (F1)

If braceless guards exist, guard-else needs clear syntax:
```
# Braceless guard (returns from function):
>=sp 1000 "gold"

# Guard-else (local conditional):
>=sp 1000{"gold"}{"silver"}    # braces required for else form
```

Braceless guards and guard-else can coexist: braceless is for the simple return case, braced is for the if/else case.

### Interaction with negated guards

```
# Current:
!verified{"not ok"}

# Braceless:
!verified "not ok"
```

Works naturally — `!verified` is a complete unary expression, `"not ok"` is the body.
